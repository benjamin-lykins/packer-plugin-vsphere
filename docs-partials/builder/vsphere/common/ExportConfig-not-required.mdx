- `name` (string) - Specifies the name of the exported image in Open Virtualization Format (OVF).
  
  -> **Note:** The name of the virtual machine with the `.ovf` extension is used if this
  option is not specified.

- `force` (bool) - Specifies to force the export and overwrite existing files. Defaults to `false`.
  
  -> **Note:** If set to `false`, the export will fail if the files already exist.

- `image_files` (bool) - Specifies to include additional image files that are that are associated with the virtual
  machine. For example, `.nvram` and `.log` files. Defaults to `false`.

- `manifest` (string) - Specifies the hash algorithm to use when generating a manifest file. Defaults to `sha256`.
  
  The available options for this setting are: 'none', 'sha1', 'sha256', and 'sha512'.
  
  --> **Tip:** Use `none` to disable the creation of a manifest file.

- `options` ([]string) - Specifies advanced image export configuration options, which include:
  
  * `mac` - MAC address is exported for each Ethernet device.
  * `uuid` - UUID is exported for the virtual machine.
  * `extraconfig` - Extra configuration options are exported for the virtual machine.
  * `nodevicesubtypes` - Resource subtypes for CD/DVD drives, floppy drives, and serial and
    parallel ports are not exported.
  
  For example, adding the following export configuration option outputs the MAC addresses for
  each Ethernet device in the OVF descriptor:
  
  HCL Example:
  
  ```hcl
  ...
    export {
      options = ["mac"]
    }
  ```
  
  JSON: Example:
  
  ```json
  ...
    "export": {
      "options": ["mac"]
    },
  ```
